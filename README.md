# xpsinstall
Everything needed for a fresh install

99% of this comes from other people, I simply assembled the parts I needed for my system.

Still very much experimental, try at your own risk.

TO INSTALL

bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/letourneaualex/xpsinstall/alex_xps_tweaks.sh)"
